# Design System

### 1. Color palette: 
Define a set of primary, secondary, and accent colors, as well as a range of neutral colors for backgrounds, text, and borders. This will help maintain visual consistency across your components.
Example:

- Primary: #3F51B5
- Secondary: #F50057
- Accent: #FFC107
- Text: #212121
- Background: #F5F5F5
- Border: #E0E0E0


### 2. Typography: 
Establish a consistent typographic scale, including font families, sizes, weights, and line-heights for various text elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and captions.
Example:

- Font Family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
- Headings: font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2
- Body: font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.5
- Captions: font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3


### 3. Iconography: 
Select or create a set of icons that can be used throughout your components. Ideally, these should be in a scalable format like SVG.
Example:

- Material Design Icons
- Font Awesome Icons
- Custom SVG icons


### 4. Spacing: 
Define a set of spacing values (margins, paddings) that can be applied consistently across components to maintain visual harmony and balance.
Example:

- Extra Small: 4px
- Small: 8px
- Medium: 16px
- Large: 24px
- Extra Large: 32px

### 5. Border Radius: 
Decide on a consistent border radius value for various UI elements like buttons, input fields, and cards.
Example:

- Border Radius: 4px

### 6. Shadows and Elevation: 
Establish a set of box-shadow values to create depth and hierarchy within your components.
Example:

- Elevation 1: box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)
- Elevation 2: box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23)

### 7. Transitions and Animations: 
Define a set of standard transition and animation durations and easing functions to create a smooth and cohesive experience.
Example:

- Transition Duration: 300ms
- Easing Function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)

### 8. Breakpoints: 
Set responsive breakpoints to cater to various screen sizes and devices.
Example:

- Extra Small: 480px
- Small: 768px
- Medium: 992px
- Large: 1200px


### 9. Component-specific styles: 
Define consistent styles for each UI component, such as buttons, input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
Example:

- Button: background-color: primary; padding: small; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: 500
